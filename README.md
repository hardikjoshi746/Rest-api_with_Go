# REST API with Go

This project demonstrates the creation of REST API using Go (Golang). The API is designed to handle CRUD operations and can be integrated with a database for persistence.

## Features

- Basic CRUD operations
  - Create: Add new records
  - Read: Retrieve records
  - Update: Modify existing records
  - Delete: Remove records
- Simple and clean architecture with handler functions for each API route
- Error handling and HTTP status codes
- Designed to be easily extensible with additional features
- Added user authentication using JWT
- Add input validation for API requests

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.20 or later installed
- A terminal or command prompt
- (Optional) A REST client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for testing API requests
- (Optional) A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for data persistence
